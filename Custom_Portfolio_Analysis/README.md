This is an educational notebook designed to help newcomers approach algorithmic trading by helping users understand the models involved with making replicable decisions. Weâ€™ll show you how to become an informed trader in 10 minutes by providing the tools to visualize the market based on price changes, this will help you devise a strategy to trade a group of stocks and maximize expected returns.


In this educational notebook, you will learn about the subjects as below:

## Historical Analysis

Performance and Risk Analysis are helpful to understand how a stock performed within a time frame. 



#### ***Performance Analysis***

* **Daily Returns**
* Purpose: Looking at the daily returns of stocks helps to see daily performance comparisons.

* **Cumulative Returns**
* Purpose: A cumulative return on an investment is the aggregate amount that the investment has gained or lost over time, in a time period.

* **Exponentially Weighted Moving Average**
* Purpose: The EWMA of a stock can be used as a condfidence indiacator, meaning that a strong but declining stock should have a hard time moving below the EWMA. EWMA can help you to determine what actions to take with an asset depending on its relative position to the close price.

#### ***Risk Analysis***

* **Risk Analysis**
* Purpose: Risk Analysis is a good tool to weigh the risk versus return for an entire portfolio or a single asset or security.

* **Standard Deviation**
* Purpose: The Standard Deviation (STD) is a measure of the volatility of a stock.

* **Sharpe Ratio**
* Purpose: The ratio describes the compensation an investor will receive for the extra volatility endured when holding a riskier asset.

* **Rolling Standard Deviation**
* Purpose: The Rolling STD looks at changes in volatility over time.

* **Rolling Mean**
* Purpose: Taking the 30 day rolling average smoothes the graphs and makes it easier to see overall trends.

#### ***Forecasting***

* **Monte Carlo Simulation**

* Purpose: The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.
